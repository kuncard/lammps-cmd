# pair_style command

## Syntax

```
pair_style style args
```

## Description

Set the formula(s) LAMMPS uses to compute pairwise interactions.  In
LAMMPS, pair potentials are defined between pairs of atoms that are
within a cutoff distance and the set of active interactions typically
changes over time.  See the bond_style command to
define potentials between pairs of bonded atoms, which typically
remain in place for the duration of a simulation.

In LAMMPS, pairwise force fields encompass a variety of interactions,
some of which include many-body effects, e.g. EAM, Stillinger-Weber,
Tersoff, REBO potentials.  They are still classified as  pairwise 
potentials because the set of interacting atoms changes with time
(unlike molecular bonds) and thus a neighbor list is used to find
nearby interacting atoms.

Hybrid models where specified pairs of atom types interact via
different pair potentials can be setup using the hybrid pair style.

The coefficients associated with a pair style are typically set for
each pair of atom types, and are specified by the
pair_coeff command or read from a file by the
read_data or read_restart
commands.

The pair_modify command sets options for mixing of
type I-J interaction coefficients and adding energy offsets or tail
corrections to Lennard-Jones potentials.  Details on these options as
they pertain to individual potentials are described on the doc page
for the potential.  Likewise, info on whether the potential
information is stored in a restart file is listed
on the potential doc page.

In the formulas listed for each pair style, E is the energy of a
pairwise interaction between two atoms separated by a distance r.
The force between the atoms is the negative derivative of this
expression.

If the pair_style command has a cutoff argument, it sets global
cutoffs for all pairs of atom types.  The distance(s) can be smaller
or larger than the dimensions of the simulation box.

In many cases, the global cutoff value can be overridden for a
specific pair of atom types by the pair_coeff
command.

If a new pair_style command is specified with a new style, all
previous pair_coeff and pair_modify command settings are erased; those commands must be
re-specified if necessary.

If a new pair_style command is specified with the same style, then
only the global settings in that command are reset.  Any previous
doc:pair_coeff <pair_coeff> and pair_modify
command settings are preserved.  The only exception is that if the
global cutoff in the pair_style command is changed, it will override
the corresponding cutoff in any of the previous pair_modify commands.

Two pair styles which do not follow this rule are the pair_style
table and hybrid commands.  A new pair_style command for these
styles will wipe out all previously specified pair_coeff and pair_modify settings, including
for the sub-styles of the hybrid command.

Here is an alphabetic list of pair styles defined in LAMMPS.  They are
also listed in more compact form on the Commands pair doc page.

Click on the style to display the formula it computes, any additional
arguments specified in the pair_style command, and coefficients
specified by the associated pair_coeff command.

There are also additional accelerated pair styles included in the
LAMMPS distribution for faster performance on CPUs, GPUs, and KNLs.
The individual style names on the Commands pair
doc page are followed by one or more of (g,i,k,o,t) to indicate which
accelerated styles exist.

## Examples

## Restrictions

Restrictions 
This command must be used before any coefficients are set by the
pair_coeff, read_data, or
read_restart commands.
Some pair styles are part of specific packages.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the Build package page for more info.  The doc pages for
individual pair potentials tell if it is part of a package.
